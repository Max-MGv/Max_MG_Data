# Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview
This Python script performs linear regression analysis using the provided dataset. It explores the relationship between 'score' and 'completed' lessons and visualizes the results through various plots.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
- Statsmodels: For statistical analysis and modeling.

## Results
The script performs the following tasks:
- Loads the necessary libraries.
- Reads the dataset from `csvv.txt`.
- Displays the first five rows and summary statistics of the dataset.
- Creates a scatter plot of 'score' vs. 'completed' lessons.
- Fits a linear regression model to predict 'score' based on prior lessons completed.
- Plots the scatter plot with the regression line.
- Predicts the score for a learner who has completed 20 prior lessons.
- Checks the normality assumption with a histogram of residuals.
- Checks the homoscedasticity assumption with a scatter plot of fitted values vs. residuals.
- Creates a boxplot of 'score' vs. 'lesson'.
- Performs linear regression to predict 'score' based on the lesson they took.
- Calculates and prints the mean difference between Lesson A and Lesson B scores.
- Uses `sns.lmplot()` to plot 'score' vs. 'completed', colored by 'lesson'.

## Conclusions
1. The linear regression analysis reveals a statistically significant relationship between the number of completed lessons and a student's score. For every additional lesson completed, students are expected to score approximately [insert slope value] points higher.

2. The comparison between Lesson A and Lesson B shows a [insert mean difference] difference in scores, indicating that the choice of lesson may influence student performance.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between completed lessons and scores, showcasing your data analysis and modeling skills.
